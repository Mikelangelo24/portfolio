                <h3>Software Development</h3>
                <p class="skill-description">In 2016 I came to the conclusion that my experience with logistics processes and ERP software as
                    Logistics planner would be a great stepping stone for my passion, user-friendly and functional software.
                    I completed a traineeship program to become a junior C# dotnet software developer as well as numerous
                    online courses, and kicked off my professional developer career.
                    I have always been interested in IT, but since my older brother was even more of a geek then me, I did
                    not realize until a few years ago that I was geek enough to also work in the field of IT.

                <h3>Flight simulation</h3>
                <p class="skill-description">Many years ago, while attending a so-called lan-party, a friend introduced me to Flight Simulator 2002.
                    Right then and there I became very fascinated with flying and the aviation industry.
                    I became very eager to learn everything about flying, commercial airplanes and airports.
                    I'm hoping that if my private life will allow for this in a few years, that I wouldhave enough spare time to join a nearby glider club.
                    Until that time, I do love to pretend being a commercial pilot from my addic 'home-cockpit' occassionally.
